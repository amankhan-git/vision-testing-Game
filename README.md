# vision-testing-Game(python)
Vision Testing Games are interactive tools designed to assess various aspects of visual function through gamified elements. They're often used for preliminary eye screening or therapy and can be browser-based or mobile/desktop apps. Since you're developing one (both browser-based and in Python), here‚Äôs a categorized breakdown to help you refine or expand your project:

üîç Common Types of Vision Tests in Games
Visual Acuity Test

Identifies how clearly a user can see.

Example: Show letters/symbols (like Snellen chart) in decreasing sizes.

Color Vision Test

Detects color blindness.

Example: Ishihara plates or color-matching tasks.

Contrast Sensitivity Test

Measures ability to distinguish between shades.

Example: Identify a faint shape or text on a background.

Peripheral Vision Test

Checks how wide a field of vision is.

Example: Tap moving objects appearing from the edges.

Eye Movement Tracking

Tests saccades and tracking.

Example: Follow a moving object with cursor or eyes (if using webcam).

Depth Perception

Measures ability to judge distance.

Example: Match the distance of objects in a 3D-like game.

üïπÔ∏è Gamified Features to Include
Scoring System for engagement.

Levels/Difficulty Scaling based on performance.

Visual Feedback (e.g., green/red cues for correct/incorrect).

Leaderboards or progress charts.

Sound Effects for feedback.

üí° Tools & Technologies
For Browser-Based Game
HTML + CSS + JavaScript

Use Canvas API for drawing tests.

setTimeout() / requestAnimationFrame() for animations.

Store scores in localStorage.

For Advanced Python Version
Python GUI: Tkinter or PyQt

Image Handling: PIL (Pillow)

Game Logic: Use pygame for smoother animations.

Data Logging: Save results locally in CSV or JSON.

üöÄ Example Game Ideas
Color Catch

Colored shapes fall from the top. Player catches only the red ones.

Focus Test

Briefly flash numbers/letters and ask user to recall.

Peripheral Pop

Random dots appear on the screen edges. User clicks when spotted.

Contrast Maze

A barely visible maze path leads to the exit. User navigates with keyboard.
